# Bosses

- i want levels to be connected, like in brick breaker revolution
- every 10-15 levels, these connected levels lead to a boss
- bosses could be reused with extra attacks/health similar to BTD6
<!-- - (might implement multiple of these) -->
- each boss could have multiple implementations, with same behaviour but different patterns

## Bullet Hell Boss

- simplest type of boss
- ball takes away health
- with certain intervals, the boss will shoot projectiles, that damage the paddle
  - PLEASE USE ATTACK INDICATORS
- might get inspired from geometry dash, cuz there also the controls are limited
  - IMPORTANT i want to keep controls simple: move paddle and use powerup

## Arena Building Boss

- the boss will keep placing new blocks
- might have a couple bulk phases (spawns blocks and nothing else happens until those are broken)
- last phase is the final battle
  - blocks are spawned in small quantities but continuously
  - when player manages to destroy all blocks, the boss is defeated

## 4* dimensional boss

- in this mode, the player has 4 paddles, one on each side of the screen
- blocks will continuously spawn, and have to be destroyed
- take inspiration from `Chicken Invanders`

## Challenge boss

- gameplay will differ from usual
- no blocks to break
- player has to save their ball for a certain time
- boss is able to manipulate ball trajectory
  - catch and throw
  - redirect
  - fake balls
  - ball has gravity

## Necromancer (?)

- usual gameplay, with a twist
- player has to damage boss with the ball
- player should avoid breaking blocks, as that heals the boss
